AVIONICS’ RESPONSIBILITY FOR SAFE AND SUSTAINABLE NEXT GENERATION AEROSPACE OPERATIONS

Digital avionics are the foundation for the kind of aviation and space flight we feel familiar with today, but aerospace finds itself in an era of tremendous changes: societal demands and geopolitical changes are transforming aerospace towards higher customization, more autonomy, greener operation and faster adaptability.

Digital avionics systems are the core enablers for many of the new technologies, functions, and operations necessitated by these changes. Furthermore, avionics systems will need to undergo a transformation towards reduced carbon footprint, higher calculation power, lower latency, and higher flexibility - all while maintaining safety and security levels and decreasing certification times: a huge responsibility for the digital avionics systems of the future. 

The 44th DASC will investigate the responsibility of digital avionics for the next generation of air and space vehicles to come. We provide the forum to present solutions making aerospace transformation possible, analyze open issues, and discuss disruptive ideas.

You are invited to present your research addressing current and future challenges of avionics systems and exchange diverse perspectives with the world’s leading experts in the field.

## Proposal

**Title**: Prepariing for Potential Closure of European Airspaces due to Re-entering Space Objects

i. conclusions

### Abstract
(background, motivation)
The risk of collision of re-entering space debris with aircraft is 
increasing both due to ever increasing number of airborne flights and
re-entries. National and international authorities need tools to balance
safety and economic/logistic impact of adopted measures.

(approach)
We asses airspaces density as flown by commercial airlines
distinguishing seasonal (summer and winter IATA season) and hourly patterns.
(method)
We base our hourly density estimation on (enhanced) flown trajectories as
recorded by EUROCONTROL's Network Manager (NM)[^1] and overlapped on Uber's H3
gridding system. Impact risk probabilities will then calculated based on work
from [@patera2008].
(conclusion)
This combined with a buffered area along the the path of re-entry,
can provide factual risk impact probabilities for deciding on closures and/or
re-routings.
(conclusion)

and 2 Comprehensive Member States covering
almost all European Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC) States.

### Synopsis
The risk of collision of re-entering space debris with aircraft is increasing due to both increasing number of airborne flights and re-entries. National and international authorities need to balance safety and economic impact of adopted measures.
We asses airspaces density as flown by commercial airlines distinguishing seasonal and hourly patterns. We base our hourly density estimation on (enhanced) flown trajectories as recorded by EUROCONTROL's Network Manager binned over Uber's H3 gridding system. Impact risk probabilities will then calculated based on work such as from (Patera R. "Risk ro commercial aircraft from reentering space debris", 2008). This combined with a buffered area along the the path of re-entry, can provide risk impact probabilities for deciding on safety measure such as airspace closures and/or re-routings.


### Extended Abstract
We base our hourly flight density estimation on (enhanced) trajectories flown by Instrument Flight Rule (IFR) commercial flights as recorded by EUROCONTROL's Network Manager (NM)1 and overlapped on Uber's H3 gridding system at different resolutions [2], see <Figure 1> for resolution 2 which corresponds to hexagons of average area 86801.78 km2 and average edge length of 182.51 km.

<Figure 1: plot of the grid system at resolution 2>

We characterise densities on an hourly basis for representative days in summer and winter.[^2]
We expand on the works of [1], [3], [4] and provide a reproducible example for States, Agencies or relevant authorities to build upon.

<Figure 2> provides a promising result in the hourly flight density calculation which shows expected outcomes such as cells at zero density for war or no-fly zones such as Ukraine, Libia or Syria. Typical traffic flows such as from central Europe to Canary Islands or Atlantic crossing are clearly visible, providing a visual confirmation of the approach.

Conclusion / Outcome

We show how National and/or International authorities could prepare for the more and more likely and frequent occurrence of uncontrolled reentry of space objects that could pose a safety concern on civilian aviation.
The techniques we implemented on realistic data and sound algorithms can contribute to the bag of tools in the hands of technical and political entities aiming at guaranteeing the utmost safety and minimal economic disruption to civil aviation in Europe.
