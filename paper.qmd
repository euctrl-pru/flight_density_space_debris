# Abstract
The risk of collision between uncontrolled re-entering space debris and aircraft
is  increasing due to both ever-growing number of airborne flights and 
of orbiting bodies (and relevant re-entries). 
National and international authorities need to balance safety and economic
impact of adopted measures should a reentry event be announced, usually on short
notice.  
We employ hourly and daily spatial density of flight calculated from
trajectories as recorded by EUROCONTROL's Network Manager and
binned over Uber's H3 gridding system.  
Impact risk probabilities are then calculated based on previous theoretical
work but using these flights trajectories instead of proxies such as
population density or ADS-B/Mode S message counts.
These densities combined with a buffered area along the eventual path of
re-entry, can provide risk impact probabilities to authorities as an aid
for deciding on safety measures such as airspace closures and/or re-routings.

# Introduction

The ever-growing forecast number of flights, see @fig-forecast, and the modern
race to commercialisation of space call for a reevaluation of the risk of
collision and casuality due to uncontrolled debris reentries.
Oversighting authorities need methodologies and tools to assess which 
safety measures are the most adequate to minimize casualties and economic
impact.

Surging number of flights in Europe [@forecastUpdate2025] and in the
world, but more importantly under development/deployment megaconstellations
of satellites on \acr{LEO} such as already active Starlink and OneWeb or
planned ones like Kuiper, Starshield, Xingwang et al. will add thousand
of orbiting objects with a short operational life some of which will 
inevitably reenter Earth atmosphere in an uncontrolled manner, cfr. @tbl-megaconstellations [@megaconstellations].

This paper develops a practical and straightforward pipeline to rapidly
assess the risk from uncontrolled reentry of space debris for the European
region.
Apart from the general risk assessment of potential reentries, we analyze
a soon to happen reentry of debris from a 1972 failed USSR mission to Venus.

# Method

We follow the same mathematical approach of 
[@patera2008; @wrightAirspaceClosuresDue2025] but instead of
approximating flight density with population density [@patera2008] or
aircraft transponder data [@wrightAirspaceClosuresDue2025], we use flown 
trajectories.

We base our hourly flight density estimation on flown \acr{IFR} trajectories as
recorded by EUROCONTROL's \acr{NM}[^1] and binned on Uber's H3 gridding system
[@uber-h3] for fast processing.  
This work will use H3 cells at resolution 3 which corresponds to hexagons of
average area $\qty{12393}{km^2}$ and average edge length of
$\qty{68.979}{km}$ [@h3resolutions] as depicted in @fig-cells.

We characterise densities on an hourly basis for the days of the 2023 and 2024
busiest \acr{IATA} summer ISO week.


We expand on the works of [@wrightAirspaceClosuresDue2025; @patera2008] and
provide a reproducible example for States, Agencies or relevant authorities
to build upon.

and 2 Comprehensive Member States covering

Next sections will develop the mathematcal background for the evaluation of
collision and casuality risk of which traffic density is a key component.

Expected outcomes such as cells at zero density for war or no-fly zones

## Impact Probability for Single Flight, Single Debris
The probability, $p_k$, of a debris (point) object $k$, impacting an
aircraft (point) object over the area, $a$, is expressed as:

$$
p_k = \varepsilon_k \int_a \rho(\vec{x}) \sigma_k(\vec{x}) da
$$

where $\rho({\vec{x}})$ is the probability density of an aircraft in $\vec{x}$,
$\sigma(\vec{x})$ is the impact probability density of a debris object $k$
in the position $\vec{x}$ and $\varepsilon_k$ is the effective exposed area,
i.e. the effective risk area for the $k^{th}$ debris object impacting
the aircraft (see @sec-eea later on).


If we discretize the area of interest $a$ using H3 cells,
we have

$$
p_k = \varepsilon_k \sum_h \rho(h) \sigma_k(h)
$$ 

So for cell $h$ we have

$$
p_{k}(h) = \varepsilon_k \rho(h) \sigma_k(h)
$$







## Aircraft effective exposed area{#sec-eea}

We assume the aircraft impact area to be much larger than the debris
object area so as to neglet the debris impact area.
We can also simplify the geometry of the aircraft and model it as
a rectangular solid with dimesions of wingspan ($W$), length ($L$) and
height ($H$). 
Now, if the aircraft were stationary, the area exposed to a debris impact would
be the top view, while if the debris were stationary it would be the front view.
In reality the aircraft is moving (manly) horizontally and the debris 
vertically [^balistic_descent], which which allows to express the effective
exposed area, $\varepsilon_k$, as

$$
\varepsilon_k = \frac{s_{a} a_{h} + s_{d_k} a_{v}}{s_{d_k}}
$$

where $s_{a}$ is the average aircraft speed, $s_{d_k}$ is the average fall speed
of the $k$-th debris object, $a_T$ area of the aircraft as viewed from the top,
$a_F$ area of the aircraft as viewed from the from the front of the aircraft.

In our calculations we will use ($t$ subscript for aircraft type)

* constant debris fall speed $s_{d_k} = \qty{145}{mph} = S$
* constant aircraft speed, $s_{a} = C_t$, equal to its cruise speed, 
* aircraft area as viewed from the top, $a_T = W_t \times L_t = A_t$, 
  where $W_t$ is the wingspan, and $L_t$ the length for the specific aircraft
  type $t$
* aircraft area as viewed from the front, $a_F = W_t \times H_t = F_t$, 
  where $W_t$ is the wingspan, and $H_t$ the height for the specific aircraft
  type $t$

The effective exposed area now only depends on the aircraft type $t$ (dimensions
and cruise speed) and can be rewritten as:

$$
\varepsilon_t = \frac{C_{t} F_{t} + S A_{t}}{S}
$$

The values $W_t$, $H_t$ and $L_t$ have been retrieved from [@performance_database;@skybrary;@doc8643].

The impact  probability for cell $h$ and single aircraft of type $t$ becomes:

$$
p_{t,k}(h) = \varepsilon_t \rho_t(h) \sigma_k(h)
$$


[^balistic_descent]: *Even for a ballistic coefficient of \qty{50}{lbs/ft^2},
the flight path angle of a reentering object at \qty{40000}{ft} is 
\ang{-86.6}, which corresponds to nearly vertical descent.
Since most debris objects have ballistic coefficients equal to or 
less than \qty{50}{lbs/ft^2}, the vertical descent assumption is a very
accurate approximation.* [@patera2008]





## Impact probability density for debris of inclination $i$

Debris that reenter the Earth’s atmosphere via drag-induced decay will fly
circular orbits prior to reentry even if initially on elliptical
ones.[^circular-orbit]

The angular position, $\theta$, of the reentry point from the ascending node, 
see @sec-orbitals, is uniformly distributed for uncontrolled rentries,
$\sigma(\theta) = 1 / (2\pi)$. This is due to uncertainties in atmospheric drag
and the gravitational effects of the Equatorial bulge.
Hence we assume that the impact longitude, $\lambda$, is uniformely distributed.

The impact probability density, $\sigma(\varphi, i)$,
at latitude $\varphi$ of a reentring object whose orbit has inclination $i$
(see @fig-orbital-elements) is given by [[Equation 15 in @patera2008]]:

$$ \sigma(\varphi, i) = \frac{1}{2 \pi^2 R^2 \sqrt{(\sin^2(i) - \sin^2(\varphi))}}$$ {#eq-impact-probability-density}

where $R$ is the distance from the center of the Earth of the object potentially
being impacted by the debris.

So for example if a building is located at latitude 30 degrees and has an area 
of $\qty{1000}{m^2}$ and a piece of debris reenters the Earth’s atmosphere
from an orbit having an inclination of 45 degrees, the impact probability is 
given by

$$\begin{aligned}
P &= \Delta A \times \sigma(\varphi, i) = 1000 \times \sigma\Bigl(\frac{\pi}{6}, \frac{\pi}{4}\Bigl) \\
  &= 1000 \times \num{2.490756e-15} = \num{2.490756e-12}
\end{aligned}$$

where we used the equatorial value of $\qty{6378}{km}$, for the Earth's radius,
$R$, as the distance of the building from the center of the planet.

The impact probability density $\sigma(\varphi, i)$ for an inclination $i$ of
$\ang{51.7}$ is plotted in @fig-weighting-inclination-i and takes a characteristic
U shape.

```{r weighting-inclination-i}
#| out-width: "100%"
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("media/figures/weighting_inclination_i.png")
```

Impact probability density $\sigma(\varphi, i = 51.7)$ for debris of inclination $i$ and altitude $\qty{550}{km}$. 
:::




[^circular-orbit]: In fact drag at perigee will lower apogee and similarly drag
at apogee will lower perigee. But because drag at perigee is higher due to
denser atmosphere, the apogee  will decrease faster than perigee and the orbit
will then tend to be a circular one.





## Impact probability density for debris

If we consider historical uncontrolled debris reentry data, we can numerically
derive the debris impact probability as a weighting function by summing up and
averaging all single densities:

$$ \sigma(\varphi) = \sum_k \sigma(\varphi, i_k)$$

From [@gcat] we extracted 1968 debris reentries during 25 calendar years from 
1st Jan 2000 till 31st Dec 2024.
The result of combining all the U-shaped densities can be seen in @fig-weighting.

#| echo: false

```

Spatially combining $\sigma(\lambda,\varphi)$ for the H3 cells in the
\acr{NM} area we obtain the weightings per cell (per hour) as in
@fig-weighting-nm-area.

## Hourly impact probability per H3 cell

When combining the hourly ($H$) aircraft density (per aircraft type) with the
relevant weightings per H3 cell, $h$, we can numerically compute the hourly
impact probability for each hexagonal cell as:

$$
 E_{h, H} =  \sum_t W(h) \cdot \rho_{t,H}(h) \cdot \varepsilon_t
$$

where $E_{h,H}$ is the collision expectation in the hexagon $h$ at hour $H$,
$W(h)$ is the median value of the weighting function over the area of hexagon
$h$,
$\rho_{t,H}(h)$ is the traffic density for the \acr{ICAO} aircraft type $t$ in
cell $h$ at hout $H$ and
$\varepsilon_t$ is effective exposed area for aircraft of type $t$.

## Use Case: KOSMOS 482 Descent Craft reentry

In few days (at the time of writing of this paper) at 6h May 10, 2025
($\pm 2.8$ days), the KOSMOS 482 Descent Craft should reenter the
Earth's atmosphere [@kosmos482reentry].
This is supposedly the lander module from a 1972 failed Soviet Venera mission
[@SpaceReviewKosmos] of \qty{480}{kg} weight and approximately
\qty{1}{m} diameter.
Being supposed to survive Venus's atmosphere which is much denser and hotter than Earth's atmosphere (surface pressure 93 times that of Earth and temperatures reaching \ang{467}C (\ang{872}F)),
it could re-enter Earth intact and not break into smaller fragments some of which could burn up.

Knowing that the debris inclination is $\ang{51.7}$,
see @fig-weighting-inclination-i, we can derive the maximum collision expectation using data for the busiest day in the busiest 2024 week as a
proxy for the traffic density on the day of reentry.




Once the reentry track is known, the H3 cells around \qty{35}{km} on each side 
can be identified to retrieve the values of collision expectancy.

# Conclusion and Future work

We show how National and/or International authorities could prepare for the more and more likely and frequent occurrence of uncontrolled reentry of space objects that could pose a safety concern on civilian aviation.
The techniques we implemented on realistic data and sound algorithms can contribute to the bag of tools in the hands of technical and political entities aiming at guaranteeing the utmost safety and minimal economic disruption to civil aviation in Europe.


Future work will explore the impact of megacostellations and flight growth
forecast and what would happen in 20, 40, ..., 100 years in varios scenarios
of uncontrolled  reentries and the risk for European airspace.

Definition of Keplerian elements. The orbital elements describing the trajectory of orbiting object are illustrated in association with an inertial reference frame $\hat{I}$-$\hat{J}$-$\hat{K}$. The $I$-axis, $\hat{I}$, points toward the vernal equinox and the $J$-axis, $\hat{J}$, is perpendicular to the $I$-axis in the equatorial plane n the sense of Earth's rotation with the $K$-axis pointing up. The semi-major axis, $a$, the eccentricity, $e$, the inclination, $i$, the right ascension of the ascending node, $\Omega$ , and the argument of perigee, $\omega$, constitute, together with the mean anomaly at the initial position, $M_0$, a set of six constants of motion that are preserved in the absence of perturbation. True anomaly, $\nu$, specifies the location of an orbiting object within the orbit. It is the angle between perigee and the orbiting object’s position vector measured in the direction of the orbiting object’s motion.
Figures from [@sellers2003understanding], respectively Figure 5-2 and Figure 5-9.

:::


We refer to @fig-orbital-elements to describe the orbital parameters of
interest for the current work.


The angular position, $\theta$, of the reentry point from the ascending node
in the orbit plane is $\theta = \omega + \nu$.
It is related to the latitude, $\varphi$, via the Cartesian coordinate $k$,
$k = R \sin(\varphi) = R \sin(\theta)\sin(i)$, or

$$\sin(\varphi) = \sin(\theta)\sin(i)$$ {#eq-spheric-coords}

Mass of Earth, $M_{\oplus} = \qty{5.9722e24}{kg}$.

These are used to derive numerically compute the weighting function,
@fig-weighting-inclination-i:
for debris with inclination $i$ we simulate an orbit of $N$, i.e. $10001$,
positions and calculate the corresponding cartesian position and the
equivalent longitude and latitude.
