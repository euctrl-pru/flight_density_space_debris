# Abstract
The risk of collision between uncontrolled re-entering space debris and aircraft
is  increasing due to both ever-growing number of airborne flights and 
of orbiting bodies (and relevant re-entries). 
National and international authorities need to balance safety and economic
impact of adopted measures should a re-entry event be announced, usually on short
notice.  
We employ hourly and daily spatial flight densities calculated from
trajectories as recorded by EUROCONTROL's Network Manager and
binned with the Uber H3 geospatial indexing system.  
Impact risk probabilities are then calculated based on previous theoretical
work. This work enhances the model by employing using actual flown flight trajectories as a basis for time-varying flight densities rather than relying on proxies such as the population density or ADS-B/Mode S message counts.
These densities combined with a buffered area along the eventual path of
re-entry, can provide mid-air impact probabilities to authorities as an aid
for deciding on safety measures such as airspace closures and/or re-routings.

# Introduction

With forecasts predicting a steadily growing number of flights, see @fig-forecast, and the modern
race to commercialise space it is clear a re-evaluation of the risks of
collision and casualties due to uncontrolled debris re-entries is needed.
Overseeing authorities need methodologies and tools to assess which 
safety measures are the most adequate to minimise potential casualties and economic
impact.

Surging number of flights in Europe [@forecastUpdate2025] and in the
world, but more importantly under development/deployment mega-constellations
of satellites in \acr{LEO}, such as already active Starlink and OneWeb or
planned ones like Kuiper, Starshield, Xingwang et al. will add thousand
of orbiting objects with a short operational life. Some of these will 
inevitably re-enter the Earth's atmosphere in an uncontrolled manner, cfr. @tbl-megaconstellations [@megaconstellations].

This paper develops a practical and straightforward pipeline to rapidly
assess the risk from uncontrolled re-entry of space debris for the European
region.
Apart from the general risk assessment of potential re-entries, 
a soon to occur re-entry of debris from a 1972 failed USSR mission to Venus is analysed.

# Method

We follow the same mathematical approach of 
[@patera2008; @wrightAirspaceClosuresDue2025] but instead of
approximating flight density with population density [@patera2008] or
aircraft transponder data [@wrightAirspaceClosuresDue2025], we use actual flown
flight trajectories.

The hourly flight density estimation is based on on flown \acr{IFR} trajectories as
recorded by EUROCONTROL's \acr{NM}[^1] and binned using Uber's H3 geospatial indexing system
[@uber-h3] in order to decrease spatial complexity which in turn enables fast processing.
This work will use H3 cells at resolution 3 which corresponds to hexagons of an
average area $\qty{12393}{km^2}$ and an average edge length of
$\qty{68.979}{km}$ [@h3resolutions] as depicted in @fig-cells.

The flight densities are characterised on an hourly basis for all days in the busiest \acr{IATA} summer ISO week in 2023 and 2024.


This paper expands the works of [@wrightAirspaceClosuresDue2025; @patera2008] and
provides a reproducible example for States, Agencies or relevant authorities
to build upon.

Next sections will develop the mathematical background for the evaluation of
collision and casualties risk of which traffic density is a key component.

## Impact probability for a single flight and single debris
The probability, $p_k$, of a debris (point) object $k$, impacting an
aircraft (point) object over the area, $a$, is expressed as:

$$
p_k = \varepsilon_k \int_a \rho(\vec{x}) \sigma_k(\vec{x}) da
$$

where $\rho({\vec{x}})$ is the probability density of an aircraft in $\vec{x}$,
$\sigma(\vec{x})$ is the impact probability density of a debris object $k$
in the position $\vec{x}$ and $\varepsilon_k$ is the effective exposed area,
i.e. the effective risk area for the $k^{th}$ debris object impacting
the aircraft (see @sec-eea later on).


Using H3 to discretise the area of interest $a$ using H3 cells gives

$$
p_k = \varepsilon_k \sum_h \rho(h) \sigma_k(h).
$$ 

Where for each cell $h$ the following applies

$$
p_{k}(h) = \varepsilon_k \rho(h) \sigma_k(h).
$$







## Aircraft effective exposed area{#sec-eea}

It is assumed the aircraft impact area to be much larger than the debris
object area so as to neglect the debris impact area.
The geometry of the aircraft is simplified and modelled as
a rectangular cuboid with dimensions of wingspan, length and height. 
Now, if the aircraft were stationary, the area exposed to a debris impact would
be the top view, while if the debris were stationary it would be the front view.
In reality an aircraft en-route is moving (mainly) horizontally and the debris 
vertically [^balistic_descent], which which allows to express the effective
exposed area, $\varepsilon_k$, as

$$
\varepsilon_k = \frac{s_{a} a_{h} + s_{d_k} a_{v}}{s_{d_k}}
$$

where $s_{a}$ is the average aircraft speed, $s_{d_k}$ is the average fall speed
of the $k$-th debris object, $a_T$ area of the aircraft as viewed from the top,
$a_F$ area of the aircraft as viewed from the from the front of the aircraft.

In the calculations the following is assumed to be true ($t$ subscript for aircraft type)

* constant debris fall speed $s_{d_k} = \qty{145}{mph} = S$
* constant aircraft speed, $s_{a} = C_t$, equal to its cruise speed, 
* aircraft area as viewed from the top, $a_T = W_t \times L_t = A_t$, 
  where $W_t$ is the wingspan, and $L_t$ the length for the specific aircraft
  type $t$
* aircraft area as viewed from the front, $a_F = W_t \times H_t = F_t$, 
  where $W_t$ is the wingspan, and $H_t$ the height for the specific aircraft
  type $t$

The effective exposed area now only depends on the aircraft type $t$ (dimensions
and cruise speed) and can be rewritten as:

$$
\varepsilon_t = \frac{C_{t} F_{t} + S A_{t}}{S}
$$

The values $W_t$, $H_t$ and $L_t$ have been retrieved from [@performance_database;@skybrary;@doc8643].

The impact probability for cell $h$ and single aircraft of type $t$ becomes:

$$
p_{t,k}(h) = \varepsilon_t \rho_t(h) \sigma_k(h)
$$


[^balistic_descent]: *Even for a ballistic coefficient of 50 lbs/ft2, the flight
path angle of a re-entering object at 40,000 feet is -86.6 degrees, which
corresponds to nearly vertical descent.
Since most debris objects have ballistic coefficients equal to or 
less than 50 lbs/ft2, the vertical descent assumption is a very
accurate approximation.* [@patera2008]


## Impact probability density for debris of inclination $i$

Debris that reenter the Earthâs atmosphere via drag-induced decay will fly
circular orbits prior to re-entry even if initially on elliptical
ones.[^circular-orbit]

The angular position, $\theta$, of the re-entry point from the ascending node, 
see @sec-orbitals, is uniformly distributed for uncontrolled rentries,
$\sigma(\theta) = 1 / (2\pi)$. This is due to uncertainties in atmospheric drag
and the gravitational effects of the Equatorial bulge.
Hence we assume that the impact longitude, $\lambda$, is uniformely distributed.

The impact probability density, $\sigma(\varphi, i)$,
at latitude $\varphi$ of a reentring object whose orbit has inclination $i$
(see @fig-orbital-elements) is given by [[Equation 15 in @patera2008]]:

$$ \sigma(\varphi, i) = \frac{1}{2 \pi^2 R^2 \sqrt{(\sin^2(i) - \sin^2(\varphi))}}$$ {#eq-impact-probability-density}

where $R$ is the distance from the center of the Earth of the object potentially
being impacted by the debris.

So for example if a building is located at latitude 30 degrees and has an area 
of $\qty{1000}{m^2}$ and a piece of debris reenters the Earthâs atmosphere
from an orbit having an inclination of 45 degrees, the impact probability is 
given by

$$\begin{aligned}
P &= \Delta A \times \sigma(\varphi, i) = 1000 \times \sigma\Bigl(\frac{\pi}{6}, \frac{\pi}{4}\Bigl) \\
  &= 1000 \times \num{2.490756e-15} = \num{2.490756e-12}
\end{aligned}$$

where we used the equatorial value of $\qty{6378}{km}$, for the Earth's radius,
$R$, as the distance of the building from the center of the planet.

The impact probability density $\sigma(\varphi, i)$ for an inclination $i$ of
$\ang{51.7}$ is plotted in @fig-weighting-inclination-i and takes a characteristic
U shape.

```{r weighting-inclination-i}
#| out-width: "100%"
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("media/figures/weighting_inclination_i.png")
```

Impact probability density $\sigma(\varphi, i = 51.7)$ for debris of inclination $i$ and altitude $\qty{550}{km}$. 
:::




[^circular-orbit]: In fact drag at perigee will lower apogee and similarly drag
at apogee will lower perigee. But because drag at perigee is higher due to
denser atmosphere, the apogee  will decrease faster than perigee and the orbit
will then tend to be a circular one.





## Impact probability density for debris

If we consider historical debris re-entry data, we can numerically derive
the debris impact probability as a weighting function by summing up and averaging
all single densities:

$$ \sigma(\varphi) = \sum_k \sigma(\varphi, i_k)$$

From [@gcat] we extracted 1968 debris re-entries during 25 calendar years from 
1st Jan 2000 till 31st Dec 2024.
The result of combining all the U-shaped densities can be seen in @fig-weighting.

#| echo: false

```

Spatially combining $\sigma(\lambda,\varphi)$ for the H3 cells in the
\acr{NM} area we obtain the weightings per cell (per hour) as in
@fig-weighting-nm-area.

## Hourly impact probability per H3 cell
By combining the hourly aircraft density (per aircraft type) with the relevant
weightings per H3 cell, we can numerically compute the hourly impact probability
for each hexagonal cell as:

$$
 E_h =  \sum_t W(h) \cdot \rho_{t}(h) \cdot \varepsilon_t
$$

where $E_h$ is the collision expectation in the hexagon $h$,
$W(h)$ is the median value of the weighting function over the area of hexagon $h$, $t$ is the \acr{ICAO} aircraft type,
$\rho_{t}(h)$ is the traffic density for type $t$ in cell $h$ and
$\varepsilon_T$ is effective exposed area for aircraft of type $t$.

## Use Case: KOSMOS 482 Descent Craft re-entry

In few days (at the time of writing this paper) at 6h May 10, 2025
($\pm 2.8$ days), the KOSMOS 482 Descent Craft should reenter the
Earth's atmosphere [@kosmos482re-entry].
This is supposedly the lander module from a 1972 failed Soviet Venera mission
[@SpaceReviewKosmos] of \qty{480}{kg} weight and circa \qty{1}{m} diameter.
Being supposed to survive Venus's atmosphere which is much denser and hotter than Earth's atmosphere (surface pressure 93 times that of Earth and temperatures reaching \qty{467}{degreesCelsius} (\qty{872}{degreesFarenheit})).
So it could re-enter Earth intact and not break into smaller fragments some of which could burn up.

With what developed in this paper, we can derive the casuality risk and
determine the maximum value using data for the busiest day in 
the busiest 2024 week.

Once the re-entry track is known more or less accurately, the relevant
H3 cells can be

# Conclusion and Future work

We show how National and/or International authorities could prepare for the more and more likely and frequent occurrence of uncontrolled re-entry of space objects that could pose a safety concern on civilian aviation.
The techniques we implemented on realistic data and sound algorithms can contribute to the bag of tools in the hands of technical and political entities aiming at guaranteeing the utmost safety and minimal economic disruption to civil aviation in Europe.

Future work will explore the impact of megacostellations and the risk for
European airspace.

Definition of Keplerian elements. The orbital elements describing the trajectory of orbiting object are illustrated in association with an inertial reference frame $\hat{I}$-$\hat{J}$-$\hat{K}$. The $I$-axis, $\hat{I}$, points toward the vernal equinox and the $J$-axis, $\hat{J}$, is perpendicular to the $I$-axis in the equatorial plane n the sense of Earth's rotation with the $K$-axis pointing up. The semi-major axis, $a$, the eccentricity, $e$, the inclination, $i$, the right ascension of the ascending node, $\Omega$ , and the argument of perigee, $\omega$, constitute, together with the mean anomaly at the initial position, $M_0$, a set of six constants of motion that are preserved in the absence of perturbation. True anomaly, $\nu$, specifies the location of an orbiting object within the orbit. It is the angle between perigee and the orbiting objectâs position vector measured in the direction of the orbiting objectâs motion.

We refer to @fig-orbital-elements to describe the orbital parameters of
interest for the current work.


The angular position, $\theta$, of the re-entry point from the ascending node
in the orbit plane is $\theta = \omega + \nu$.
It is related to the latitude, $\varphi$, via the Cartesian coordinate $k$,
$k = R \sin(\varphi) = R \sin(\theta)\sin(i)$, or

$$\sin(\varphi) = \sin(\theta)\sin(i)$$ {#eq-spheric-coords}

Mass of Earth, $M_{\oplus} = \qty{5.9722e24}{kg}$.

These are used to derive numerically compute the weighting function,

for debris with inclination $i$ we simulate an orbit of $N$, i.e. $10001$,
positions and calculate the corresponding cartesian position and the
equivalent longitude and latitude.
