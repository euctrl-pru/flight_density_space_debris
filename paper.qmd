# Abstract
The risk of collision of re-entering space debris with aircraft is 
increasing due to both increasing number of airborne flights and
re-entries. National and international authorities need to balance
safety and economic impact of adopted measures.  
We asses airspaces density as flown by commercial airlines
distinguishing seasonal and hourly patterns.
We base our hourly density estimation on (enhanced) flown trajectories as
recorded by EUROCONTROL's \acr{NM} binned over Uber's H3
gridding system. Impact risk probabilities will then calculated based on work
from [@patera2008].
This combined with a buffered area along the the path of re-entry,
can provide risk impact probabilities for deciding on safety measure such as
airspace closures and/or re-routings.

# Introduction

We base our hourly flight density estimation on (enhanced) trajectories flown
by \acr{IFR} commercial aircraft as
recorded by EUROCONTROL's \acr{NM}[^1] and overlapped on Uber's H3
gridding system at different resolutions [@h3resolutions], see @fig-cells 
for resolution 2 which corresponds to hexagons of average area $86801.78\ km^2$
and average edge length of $182.51 km$, see also table

We characterise densities on an hourly basis for representative days
in summer and winter.[^2]


We expand on the works of [@wrightAirspaceClosuresDue2025; @patera2008; @ailorLargeConstellationDisposal2020] and
provide a reproducible example for States, Agencies or relevant authorities
to build upon.

[^1]: NM coordinates \acr{ATFCM} operations on behalf of EUROCONTROL's 42 Member States
and 2 Comprehensive Member States covering
almost all \acr{ECAC} States.

[^2]: We will consider representative days in \acr{IATA} summer 2024 
and winter 2025 season.


@fig-density-winter-res-3 provides a promising result in the hourly flight
density calculation which at least shows
expected outcomes such as cells at zero density for war or no-fly zones such as
Ukraine, Libia or Syria.

# Method

## Impact probability density

From Equation 15 in [@patera2008], the (on the ground) impact probability
density, $\sigma(L, i)$, at latitude $L$ of a reentring object
whose orbit has inclination $i$ (see @fig-orbital-inclination) is given by:

$$ \sigma(L, i) = \frac{1}{2 \pi^2 R^2 \sqrt{(\sin^2(i) - \sin^2(L))}}$$

where $R$ is the Earth's radius.

```

Orbital inclination is the angle between the plane of an orbit and the equator. An orbital inclination of 0° is directly above the equator, 90° crosses right above the pole, and 180° orbits above the equator in the opposite direction of Earth’s spin. (NASA illustration by Robert Simmon.).

## Aircraft effective exposed area
From Patera

> Even for a ballistic coefficient of 50 lbs/ft2, the flight path angle
> of a reentering object at 40,000 feet is -86.6 degrees, which corresponds
> to nearly vertical descent.
> Since most debris objects have ballistic coefficients equal to or 
> less than 50 lbs/ft2, the vertical descent assumption is a very
> accurate approximation.

$$
\varepsilon_i = \frac{s_{a} a_{h} + s_{d} a_{v}}{s_d}
$$
where $s_{a}$ is the average aircraft speed, $s_{d}$ is the average debris 
object fall speed, $a_v$ area of the aircraft as viewed from above,
$a_h$ area of the aircraft as viewed from the from the front of the aircraft.

# Conclusion / Outcome

We show how National and/or International authorities could prepare for the more and more likely and frequent occurrence of uncontrolled reentry of space objects that could pose a safety concern on civilian aviation.
The techniques we implemented on realistic data and sound algorithms can contribute to the bag of tools in the hands of technical and political entities aiming at guaranteeing the utmost safety and minimal economic disruption to civil aviation in Europe.
